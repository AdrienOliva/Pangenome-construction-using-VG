# Pangenome-construction-using-VG
Steps to the creation of a pangenome in VG using Singularity -- CSIRO INTERNSHIP 2023
The goal is to understand how singularity and vg work, in order to build a Pangenome.


# Installing and Using Singularity


This step requires conda.
To install singularity, use the following :
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge singularity 
```
Install SAMTools via conda :

```sh
conda install -c bioconda samtools
```
SAMTools will be used later to edit the VCF files to make subgroups with 0.1% minor allele frequency or above, and to merge all VCF files into one.

Creating an environment, here ```pang```, in conda :
```sh
conda create pang
conda activate pang
```
Building an image in singularity from an image in the docker library :
```sh
singularity help build
// this is to see the different options to create the image
singularity build image.sif docker://quay.io/vgteam/vg:v1.48.0   
singularity shell image.sif
```
Here, the image ```quay.io/vgteam/vg:v1.48.0``` is the one used to be able to launch vg.

Let's check if it worked properly :
```sh
singularity inspect image.sif
```
It should return something like the following :
```sh
org.label-schema.build-arch: amd64
org.label-schema.build-date: Thursday_11_May_2023_10:16:5_ACST
org.label-schema.schema-version: 1.0
org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap: docker
org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.from: quay.io/vgteam/vg:v1.48.0
org.label-schema.usage.singularity.version: 3.8.6
```

However, it is necessary to bind the singularity container with the VCF files. 
By default Singularity bind mounts ```/home/$USER```
Assume the files are in the directory ```data``` :
```sh
singularity shell --bind data:/mnt image.sif
```
If needed, it is possible to run several instances of the image at the same time, see https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/running_services.html


Now vg can be launched :
```sh
vg help 
```
